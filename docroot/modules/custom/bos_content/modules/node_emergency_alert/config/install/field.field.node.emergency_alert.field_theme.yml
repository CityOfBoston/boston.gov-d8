description: "The emergency alert has two states: \r\n<br>1) Preparation (the alert will display with dark blue background), and \r\n<br>2) Active (the alert will display with red background)\r\n<br>\r\n<br><b>As an example: </b>\r\n<br> - When there is snow coming but the city has not declared snow emergency yet - use the preparation state. \r\n<br> - When the city has a snow emergency in effect - use the active state. \r\n<br> - When a snow emergency has ended but there remains a lot of work to clean up - it may be appropriate to keep the alert active with a preparation state."

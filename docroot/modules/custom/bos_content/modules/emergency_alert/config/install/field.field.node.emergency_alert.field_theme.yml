description: "The emergency alert has two states: 1) Preparation and 2) Active. When in preparation state, the alert will display dark blue. When in active, it will display red. \n\nAs an example: when there is snow coming and no snow emergency has been declared, use the preparation state. When a snow emergency takes effect, use the active state. When a snow emergency has ended, but there's a lot of work to clean up, the preparation state may be appropriate to deploy."

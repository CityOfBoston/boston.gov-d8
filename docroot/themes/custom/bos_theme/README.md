This is the theme for boston.gov.  It is build upon the core theme "stable".   
Therefore any templates will be selected in this order:   
* Suggestion from a module
* This Theme 
* Stable theme 

For sanity, and good practice, the folder structure in this themes "templates" folder 
should mirror the structure found at "/core/themes/stable/templates" as 
much as possible..

#  These commands need to be run as normal user from lando.yml.
#
#  NOTE: THIS SCRIPT SHOULD BE RUN INSIDE THE CONTAINER.
#
#  These commands install Drupal, sync down a database from Acquia
#  and update that Database with local & current repo settings.
#
#  PRE-REQUISITES:
#     - docker container for appserver is created and started, and
#     - main boston.gov repo is already cloned onto the host machine, and
#     - .lando.yml and .config.yml files are correctly configured.
#
#  Basic workflow:
#     1. Use composer to gather all Drupal core and contributed modules.
#     2. Clone the private repo and merge into the main repo.
#     3. Prepare/update settings.php and other settings files
#     4. Create the Drupal MySQL Database (initialize new or sync existing from remote)
#     5. Import configuration from main repo (already cloned locally)
#     6. Ensure the Drupal site is configured properly for develop activities
#     7. Run any finalization tasks to complete.

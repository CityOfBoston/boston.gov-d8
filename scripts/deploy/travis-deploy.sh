# What does this script do?
# This script will watch for a Travis build on a specific
# $source_branch on the canonical GitHub repository and deploy build artifacts

# The deploy will be performed by phing, using settings in phing-boston.yml.

# How to use this script?
# This script should be executed in the `after_success` section of .travis.yml.
# It requires two arguments. Example call:
# `scripts/deploy/travis-deploy.sh master`

source_branch=$1  # The branch to watch.

# will not trigger deployment unless DEPLOY_PR is true.
